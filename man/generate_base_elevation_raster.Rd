\title{using ofr98-393, make a contour line to raster product. The units on
base elevation are feet (imperial). We are going to change them to
meters so they are consistent with surface DEMs from NED.}
\usage{
generate_base_elevation_raster(s = NULL, targetRasterGrid = NULL,
  two_pass = T, feet_to_meters = T, mask = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{two_pass}{Boolean. Should we do a second pass of IDW interpolation to remove artifacts in
base elevation.}

\item{feet_to_meters}{Boolean. Should we convert feet into meters?}
